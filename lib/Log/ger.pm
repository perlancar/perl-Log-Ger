# ABSTRACT: A lightweight, flexible logging framework

=for Pod::Coverage ^(.+)$

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your module (producer):

 package Foo;
 use Log::ger; # will import some logging methods e.g. log_warn, log_error

 sub foo {
     ...
     # produce some logs
     log_error "an error occurred: %03d - %s", $errcode, $errmsg;
     ...
     log_debug "http response: %s", $http; # automatic dumping of data
 }
 1;

In your application (consumer/listener):

 use Foo;
 use Log::ger::Output 'Screen';

 foo();


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Log::ger is yet another logging framework with the following features:

=over

=item * Separation of producers and consumers/listeners

Like L<Log::Any>, this offers a very easy way for modules to produce some logs
without having to configure anything. Configuring output, level, etc can be done
in the application as log consumers/listeners. To read more about this, see the
documentation of L<Log::Any> or L<Log::ger::Manual> (but nevertheless see
L<Log::ger::Manual> on why you might prefer Log::ger to Log::Any).

=item * Lightweight and fast

B<Slim distribution.> No non-core dependencies, extra functionalities are
provided in separate distributions to be pulled as needed.

B<Low startup overhead.> Only ~0.5-1ms. For comparison, L<strict> ~0.2-0.5ms,
L<warnings> ~2ms, L<Log::Any> 0.15 ~2-3ms, Log::Any 1.049 ~8-10ms,
L<Log::Log4perl> ~35ms. This is measured on a 2014-2015 PC and before doing any
output configuration. For more benchmarks, see L<Bencher::Scenarios::LogGer> or
try yourself e.g. with L<bencher-code>:

 % bencher-code 'use Log::ger' 'use Log::Any' --startup

B<Fast>. Low null-/stealth-logging overhead, about 1.5x faster than Log::Any, 3x
faster than Log4perl, and 5x faster than L<Log::Fast>.

B<Conditional compilation.> There is a plugin to optimize away unneeded logging
statements, like assertion/conditional compilation, so they have zero runtime
performance cost. See L<Log::ger::Plugin::OptAway>.

Being lightweight means the module can be used more universally, from CLI to
long-running daemons to inside routines with tight loops.

=item * Flexible

B<Customizable levels and routine/method names.> Can be used in a procedural or
OO style. Log::ger can mimic the interface of L<Log::Any>, L<Log::Contextual>,
L<Log::Log4perl>, or some other popular logging frameworks, to ease migration or
adjust with your personal style.

B<Per-package settings.> Each importer package can use its own format/layout,
output. For example, some modules that are migrated from Log::Any uses
Log::Any-style logging, while another uses native Log::ger style, and yet some
other uses block formatting like Log::Contextual. This eases code migration and
teamwork. Each module author can preserve her own logging style, if wanted, and
all the modules still use the same framework.

B<Dynamic.> Outputs and levels can be changed anytime during run-time and
logging routines will be updated automatically. This is useful in situation like
a long-running server application: you can turn on tracing logs temporarily to
debug problems, then turn them off again, without restarting your server.

B<Interoperability.> There are modules to interop with Log::Any, either consume
Log::Any logs (see L<Log::Any::Adapter::LogGer>) or produce logs to be consumed
by Log::Any (see L<Log::ger::Output::LogAny>).

B<Many output modules and plugins.> See C<Log::ger::Output::*>,
C<Log::ger::Format::*>, C<Log::ger::Layout::*>, C<Log::ger::Plugin::*>. Writing
an output module in Log::ger is easier than writing a Log::Any::Adapter::*.

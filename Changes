        - [Incompatible change] Another round of internal refactoring and
          interface changes. New: Log::ger::{Plugin,Format,Filter}. Every plugin
          (including filter, format, output) can be set on a per-target basis or
          globally. The term 'hooks' is in again. Add 'create_routine_names'
          phase. Remove 'after_create_log_routine',
          'after_create_log_is_routine'. Move FAQ & internals doc to
          Log-ger-Manual dist.

	- [Bugfix] Log::ger::Output didn't have VERSION.


0.003   2017-06-21 (PERLANCAR)

	- Split Log::err::Output::Screen to its own dist so this dist can
	  be more minimalist and that module can be tested e.g. with
	  Capture::Tiny etc.

	- String output: add option append_newline to allow disable
	  appending newline.

	- import(): No need to turn category 'Foo::Bar' -> 'foo.bar'.

	- [doc] Update module name Log::ger::LogAny -> Log::ger::Output::LogAny.
